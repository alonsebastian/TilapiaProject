TilapiaProject
==============

A project I worked on for different engineering competitions that ultimately earned me a Grand Award at the Intel ISEF (International Science and Engineering Fair). This software combined with many other technologies (micro-controlled field device, facility engineering, etc) allowed me to grow Tilapia in Argentina in a safe and investment-worthy manner.

Consisting of several modules, the software communicates with a field device and it's microcontroller through USB or RS232 and stores all the data, generating real-time graphics and updating several online services that provide information to the producer regardless of where he is at the time.
